# Applications and Dataset Samples

For practicing large-scale computing and data analysis problems, we collect the following applications and datasets

* [MLPerf HPC](https://mlcommons.org/en/news/mlperf-hpc-v07/): ML benchmark and HPC
* [Computational Design of Cold Bent Glass Fa√ßades](https://github.com/russelmann/cold-glass-acm)
* [Astaroth](https://bitbucket.org/jpekkila/astaroth/src/master/): Recommended GPU tool for the course.
* [Pencil Code](https://github.com/pencil-code/pencil-code): To have a peek to the CPU-MPI paradigm, one can also try out this open-source multi-physics code package. It has the benefit of containing many different pre-existing samples that one can scale up and adapt to generate large data sets.
