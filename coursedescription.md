## Overview

This is a special couse on Large-Scale Computing and Data Analysis.
The learning goal is to familiariaze the students with high-performance
computing tools in use in present-day supercomputing facilities,
and to practical applications that they can be utilized on. During this
project-oriented course, the students are working hands on with pre-existing tools on challenging problems and data sets in a real supercomputing environment.
In addition to working on a specific tool/application individually/in teams, the students will learn from
other tools and applications through demonstrations by other students/teams.

## Plan and Assessment
A preliminary list of topics has been collected below, but more topics are
being collected during the early spring, and students can also propose their
own topic. A supercomputing environment will be set up for the course participants (hosted at [CSC](https://research.csc.fi)),
hence the number of participants is limited to 10-12 students. Depending on the
selection of topics, the students can either work individually or in teams.
After introductory lecture(s) on how the environment works,
the instructors of the topic will set up weekly meetings with the student (teams), and give materials and
instructions on the project (introduction to the tool,
documentations, papers, demonstration of the usage). After introductory session(s),
the weekly meetings will serve as project update sessions. In the end of the course,
the student (teams) are expected to give demonstrations to other student (teams) on their project.
Participation in 80% of the sessions and a successful demonstration session to other students
is required to pass the course. A session participation missed can be compensated by
writing a learning diary in the form of a short email (or equivalent) to the instructor.
